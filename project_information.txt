FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT TREE:

system.h - All configuration goes in here

user.h -   Custom user function prototypes in here

configuration_bits.c - Contains device configuration bit macros.  Refer to
the comments in configuration_bits.c for instructions on where to get
information about device configuration bits and their corresponding macros.

interrupts.c - Contains modbus interrupts but also will contain user interrupts

main.c - Main source file.. 

system.c - Contains communication code and specific modbus functions needed

user.c - Where the user can put their own custom code.

modbus.c- Modbus specific functions

FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT BUT NOT IN THE PROJECT TREE:

#include <htc.h>             /* Global Header File */
#include <stdint.h>          /* For uint8_t definition */
#include <stdbool.h>         /* For true/false definition */

These files come with the HiTech compiler.  Check the compiler documentation for
